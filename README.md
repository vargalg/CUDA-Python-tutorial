# A tutorial on CUDA in python (using Numba)

This is a tutorial on writing cuda code in python. Although the usability of this knowledge is more wide-spread the
final use case of this series is writing GPU accelerated custom layers for pytorch.

This knowledge might boost AI research in enabling operations that were not implemented before, and give an advantage
to the ones having learned these useful skills.

## Prerequisites

The tutorial assumes that reader has basic knowledge oy programming and Python.

**Be aware!** GPU computing is not simple. You need to put in the effort to learn it.

## Structure

Tutorial is built up as a series of "lessons". Each lesson consists of an explanation examples.
